Due to some copyright problem, source codes can be open accessed while raw data used are not uploaded to this repository.

In order to execute those codes, you have to download all population census data from:

https://www.e-stat.go.jp/gis/statmap-search?page=1&type=1&toukeiCode=00200521

For this branch of the program, you will need 500m grid data.
Put them into data/rawdata/ , according to the census year.
Make sure they are in .csv fomat.

Outcomes are not provided here, due to their absurbly large file size.
