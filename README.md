MAPPING HIGH RESOLUTION POPULATION DISTRUBUTION OF JAPAN

## Declaration

This is a repository of the Bacholar Degree Thesis written by the author. 

250mPOP = Population Grid with 500m resolution

500mPOP = Population Grid with 500m resolution

BuildupPOP = Buildup area X Population Grid with 100m resolution


## Improvement

I decided to rewrite the whole program with better algorithms.
