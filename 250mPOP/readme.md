# 250m Population Grid

You need to download all the raw data from e-stat.go.jp and put them under the "data/" folder.

Results are having file size too larger that I am not able to upload them.

So you need to execute these programs in order to see the results.

Execution time will be 3-7hr depends on what PC you are using.
